**Issue Tracker**

1) SET NODE_ENV to `test` without quotes to run tests (For some tests, you'll have to update issue IDs, titles, and data in `tests/2_functional-tests.js` so that they match your new test entries).
2) Logic is contained in `routes/api.js`.
3) Security features are in `server.js`.
4) All functional tests are in `tests/2_functional-tests.js`.
